⚙️ How It Works
This tool sends a high volume of traffic from a single source to a target IP/port.
Because it uses your real IP address, it is easy to detect and block — making it a perfect example of why DDoS botnets exist.

🛡️ Why Open Source?
Transparency in security helps defenders understand how to protect their systems.
By learning how simple DoS attacks work, you can better configure firewalls, rate limits, and monitoring tools.
